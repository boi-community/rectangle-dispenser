# Rectangle Dispenser
## A Four Souls trigger/response card bot

Rectangle Dispenser is an enhanced, standalone version of [jerbot-neo](https://github.com/jerbmega/jerbot-neo)'s old Four Souls card functionality, featuring a cleaner codebase, fuzzy searching, new options, and a much more maintainable card update method.

Rectangle Dispenser was originally written by Roro, ItsVeesus, and Maths. Due to the original bot (now found on the `legacy` branch) regularly hitting the Discord ratelimit for no explicable reason, I took the opportunity to rewrite the bot into what it is now, with the hopes that at least if the ratelimits still happen, the code is more maintainable and easy to understand.
